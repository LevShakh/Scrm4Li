USE CASE

First I describe how the process of making deals works:
1. Make a list of familiar people - whom manager know in his life.
2. Make a call to someone
3. Arrange a meeting (online of offline - preferred)
4. Pass the meeting - tell about money saving principles and life insurance.
5. Max - make a contract (10000 UAH minimum). Min - arrange another meeting / presentation / LIFT etc.
6. Invite to StartUp seminar

Manager wants to add client to his own client base.
Sets a STATUS of a client (killed/invited/missed/in work/disabled/client)
-killed - familiar person doesn't like idea and he is ready to stop being friends with you;
-invited - first meeting is assigned;
-missed - he/she didn't come to meeting and gone (difference between killed and missed - in emotional result: either furious and stubborn or quietly gone and stupid);
-in work - client is interested in product and curious about everything;
-disabled - client is not ready to buy a polis, but he liked an idea;
-client - obvious!
